## 1 - Hello, Swift

September 20th, GDC 1.304, 7:00-8:30PM

### What We Did

* Talked about the playground environment and how [REPLs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read–eval–print_loop) let you get up and running quickly.
* Walked through some of the basic elements of Swift
  * The difference between `let` and `var` and how they keep you from making mistakes
  * Swift is strongly typed, but can infer a lot of information. If you don't like it's inferences or it can't infer, just use the colon to give it what it needs: `let myString: String = "Hello, world!"`
  * Swift's pattern matching enables very powerful versions of traditional programming constructs. [This](](http://www.codingexplorer.com/pattern-matching-in-swift/) excellent article talks about every place in the language that this concept shows up, and will help you bridge the gap between Swift and your existing knowledge.
  * The notion of the optional is a powerful way to describe uncertainty, potential for failure, or nullability (as other languages might call it). This is used extensively in the app lifecycle.
  * An app is made up of classes. You can explore how these classes relate by using the option key
